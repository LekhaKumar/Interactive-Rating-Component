## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap 5
- JQuery


### What I learned

I have just learned the basics of JQuery and I try to implement the learning into this project for the better understanding and through this submission of the project, I wish to get feedbacks from other coders to improve my JS and JQuery skills.


### Continued development

Through the implementation of JQuery, I can save my time on writing lengthy codes and I can use this knowledge by implementing this library in upcoming projects.
